## System Context (Level 1):
A System Context diagram provides an overview of how the software system fits into the broader world around it. 
It shows the system’s external dependencies, interactions, and boundaries.
Key questions at this level:
- What are the external systems that interact with our software system?
- What are the high-level functions our system performs?

## Containers (Level 2):
A Container diagram zooms into the software system, focusing on the high-level technical building blocks (containers). Containers can be web servers, databases, microservices, etc.
Key questions at this level:
- What are the major components of our system?
- How do these components interact with each other?

## Components (Level 3):
A Component diagram dives deeper into an individual container, revealing the internal components within it. Components represent cohesive units of functionality.
Key questions at this level:
- What are the specific modules or services within each container?
- How do these components collaborate to achieve system functionality?

## Code (Level 4):
At the lowest level, a code diagram (e.g., UML class diagram) focuses on an individual component. It shows how classes, methods, and relationships are implemented.
Key questions at this level:
- What are the classes, interfaces, and methods within a component?
- How is the code organized?
