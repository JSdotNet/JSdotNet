# Introduction
JSdotNet is intended as leaning traject for myself. It consists of 4 main learning areas:
- C4 modeling wit Structurizr
- Blazor
- Clean Architecture with .Net 8
- Infra as code deployment

It will be a continuation on the [`Template project`](https://github.com/JSdotNet/Template), with a more specific functional case.

I intent for the site to describe itself, so I will not go into detail here.
